# My-Portfolio
A comprehensive portfolio showcasing my scientific articles, AI prediction project, Power BI project, and database management projects, highlighting my expertise in research, coding, and data analysis

As a data scientist/analyst, my journey from sports coaching to research and into the commercial realm has shaped my passion for data analysis and decision-making. With a strong background in project management and pedagogical competence, I have developed a unique set of skills in both quantitative and qualitative analytics. Through my time as an elite sports coach, I recognized the power of data-driven insights in optimizing performance. This led me to delve into research, where I honed my abilities in data collection, analysis, and project coordination. As my curiosity expanded, I discovered the broader applications of analytics beyond sports, taking me closer to the commercial sector. Proficient in programming languages such as R, MATLAB, Python, and SQL, I am well-equipped to handle complex datasets. With a focus on leveraging data to drive informed decision-making, I am excited to use my my-profile repository to show some of my work.

My-portfolio is devided into 4 directories (branches): Scientific Articles, Data Science, Data Analysis and Other.

PS I have just started to throw together my portfolio, I hope to have the first version of my portfolio finished by the end of March 2024
